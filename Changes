  hg.

- Tweaks to handle Fey 0.10 API changes.


0.04   2008-02-20

- Fix a bug in the dsn() method.


0.03   2008-02-07

- The one test that ran failed if Fey wasn't already installed,
  leading to a circular dependency. Now the one test that runs will
  always succeed.


0.02   2008-02-06

- Make sure at least one test runs so I don't get UNKNOWN reports from
  CPAN testers.

- Add proper prereqs.
